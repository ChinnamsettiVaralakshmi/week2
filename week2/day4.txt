Algorithm  to print the multiplication table
step 1:  start
step 2: declare variables n,i,result
step 3 : read the values into n=2,i=1 (here n value is constant )
step 4: Now check the condition that i value is less than 0r equal to (i<=10)
step 5: if it is true than calculate (n*i)then store the value into result (result=n*i)
step 6:print result
step7:now increment the i value by (i=i++)
step 8: now repeat the steps 4,5,6,7,until it satisfies the condition(i<=10)
step 9: stop
