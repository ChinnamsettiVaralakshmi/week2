step1: start
step2: declare count,sum
step3: Assigning the value 1 into count and assigning value '0' to sum
step4: adding count value to sum and store that result into sum (sum-->sum+count)
step5: increment the count value by 1 (count-->count+1)
step6: repeat these step 4 and step 5 until it reaches the count value lessthan or equal to 10
       (count<=10) otherwise go to step7
step7: print sum
step8: stop


print the summ 1 to 20 numbers
step1:start
step2:declare variable count,sum
step3:Assign the variable 1 into count and value 0 to sum
step4:calculate count is divided by 2 if it is remainder to zero it is an even otherwise not even
step5:sum=sum+1
step6:increment the count value by 1 
step7:repeat the step4 and step5 until it reaches the lessthan equal to twenty
step8:print sum
step9:stop
